# Network Traffic Analyzer

This is a Python script that uses the Scapy library to analyze incoming network traffic. The script can detect incoming ICMP pings and TCP SYN scans to a specified IP address.

## Getting Started

To use the Network Traffic Analyzer, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:


## Usage

To use the script, run the `network_traffic_analyzer.py` script with Python:


The script will start sniffing incoming network traffic and print out any incoming ICMP pings or TCP SYN scans to the console.

## Configuration

You can configure the IP address to listen on by changing the `host` variable at the top of the script:


You can also modify the filters used to detect incoming traffic by modifying the `icmp_filter` and `tcp_filter` variables:


By default, the script listens for incoming ICMP packets and TCP SYN packets to the `host` IP address.
